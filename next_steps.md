Okay, I've reviewed the "ToolChest" project files. Here's a suggested 3-step plan focusing on improvements and completing existing work, which will build a strong foundation for new features:

### Next Steps for Your ToolChest Project

Here's a plan for the next three things you could focus on:

1.  **[DONE] Complete Pending Automated Tests**
    * **Why:** Your test suite has several pending tests (`test.todo`) across different areas, notably in error handling (`ToolChest/tests/middleware/errorHandler.test.ts`) and database interactions (`ToolChest/tests/database/database.test.ts`). Completing these tests is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of your existing codebase. A robust test suite will also make future refactoring and feature development safer and more efficient.
    * **How (Completed):**
        * Prioritized and implemented all `test.todo` items in `ToolChest/tests/middleware/errorHandler.test.ts`, covering various scenarios (404, 500, 400 errors for both HTML and HTMX responses).
        * Addressed `test.todo` items in `ToolChest/tests/database/database.test.ts` by:
            * Implementing a test for database connectivity.
            * Implementing a test to check for correct schema application (verified `Tool` table).
            * Implementing a test for seeding logic (verified expected data after clearing and re-populating).
            * Removing one `test.todo` related to generic model operations as no specific logic was identified for it at this time.
        * No other test files with `test.todo`s were specified for review in this step.

2.  **[IN PROGRESS] Implement Static Pages**
    * **Why:** The static pages for "Privacy Policy," "Terms of Service," and "Contact Us" are currently placeholders. These pages are standard and important for user trust and providing essential information.
    * **How (Partially Completed):**
        * Created placeholder Nunjucks templates extending `base.njk` in `src/templates/pages/static/`:
            * `src/templates/pages/static/privacy.njk`
            * `src/templates/pages/static/terms.njk`
            * `src/templates/pages/static/contact.njk`
        * Updated `ToolChest/src/controllers/staticPageController.ts` to render these new Nunjucks templates.
    * **Next Steps for User:**
        * Fill in the actual content for `privacy.njk`, `terms.njk`, and `contact.njk` within the `{% block content %}`.
        * Ensure these pages are accessible and linked appropriately, perhaps from the footer of your application layout (e.g., in `src/templates/components/footer.njk`).

3.  **[DONE] Refine "Popular Tools" Logic**
    * **Why:** The `getPopularTools` method in `ToolChest/src/services/toolService.ts` previously ordered popular tools by their creation date (`createdAt`). To truly reflect popularity, this logic now primarily considers `usageCount` and `updatedAt` from the `ToolUsageStats` and `Tool` tables, respectively.
    * **How (Completed):**
        * Modified the Prisma query within the `getPopularTools` method in `ToolChest/src/services/toolService.ts`.
        * The `orderBy` clause now prioritizes `toolUsageStats.usageCount` (descending) and then, as a secondary sorting key, `updatedAt` (descending).
        * Verified that the `toolUsageStats` relation is correctly included and accessed, and that the DTO mapping in `ToolChest/src/dto/tool.dto.ts` handles `usageCount`.
        * Updated relevant tests in `ToolChest/tests/services/toolService.test.ts` to reflect this new sorting logic, including adjusting mock data and assertions.
        * Confirmed that cache clearing for popular tools is handled by the existing `recordToolUsage` method, which flushes the entire cache.

Completing these steps will significantly improve the robustness, completeness, and accuracy of your ToolChest application, setting a solid stage for developing new tools and features.
