# ToolChest - Next Steps

This document outlines recommended next steps to strengthen the foundation of the ToolChest project before expanding with additional tools.

## 1. Testing (High Priority)

The codebase currently lacks automated tests, which are crucial for maintaining reliability as the project grows.

### Recommendations:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Implement tests for `Base64ServiceImpl` to verify encoding/decoding functionality
  - Add tests for any utility functions or helpers
  - Use JUnit 5 or KotlinTest for assertions

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Add tests for route handlers using `ktor-server-test-host`
  - Verify proper rendering of templates with expected data
  - Test form submissions and HTMX interactions

- **Test Structure**:
  ```
  src/
  └── test/
      └── kotlin/
          └── com/
              └── toolchest/
                  ├── services/
                  │   └── Base64ServiceImplTest.kt
                  └── routes/
                      ├── HomeRoutesTest.kt
                      └── Base64RoutesTest.kt
  ```

- **Sample Test Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  // Base64ServiceImplTest.kt
  package com.toolchest.services

  import kotlin.test.Test
  import kotlin.test.assertEquals

  class Base64ServiceImplTest {
      private val service = Base64ServiceImpl()
      
      @Test
      fun `encodeString should correctly encode text to Base64`() {
          val input = "Hello, World!"
          val expected = "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
          assertEquals(expected, service.encodeString(input))
      }
      
      // Add more tests for other methods and edge cases
  }
  ```

## 2. Error Handling & Custom Error Pages (High Priority)

The current error handling is basic and lacks user-friendly error pages.

### Recommendations:

- Create custom error templates for common HTTP status codes:
  - Create `/templates/pages/error.ftl` with dynamic content based on error code
  - Enhance StatusPages plugin to use these templates
  
- Implement structured error responses for both UI and API endpoints:
  ```kotlin
  install(StatusPages) {
      status(HttpStatusCode.NotFound) { call, _ ->
          call.respond(FreeMarkerContent(
              "pages/error.ftl",
              mapOf(
                  "errorCode" to 404,
                  "errorTitle" to "Page Not Found",
                  "errorMessage" to "The page you're looking for doesn't exist."
              )
          ))
      }
      
      exception<Throwable> { call, cause ->
          // Log the error with structured information
          call.application.log.error("Unhandled exception", cause)
          
          call.respond(FreeMarkerContent(
              "pages/error.ftl",
              mapOf(
                  "errorCode" to 500,
                  "errorTitle" to "Internal Server Error",
                  "errorMessage" to "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later."
              )
          ))
      }
  }
  ```

## 3. Database Integration (Medium Priority)

The project includes dependencies for SQLite and Exposed ORM but doesn't implement any database functionality.

### Recommendations:

- Create a `database` package with database setup and migration code
- Implement a simple schema for storing tool usage analytics or user preferences
- Use Exposed DSL for type-safe SQL operations

```kotlin
// Database setup example
package com.toolchest.database

import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SchemaUtils
import java.io.File

object ToolUsage : Table() {
    val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
    val toolName = varchar("tool_name", 50)
    val usageCount = integer("usage_count")
    val lastUsed = long("last_used")
    
    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}

fun Application.configureDatabases() {
    val dbFile = File("data/toolchest.db")
    dbFile.parentFile.mkdirs() // Ensure directory exists
    
    Database.connect("jdbc:sqlite:${dbFile.absolutePath}", "org.sqlite.JDBC")
    
    transaction {
        // Create tables if they don't exist
        SchemaUtils.create(ToolUsage)
    }
}
```

## 4. Documentation (Medium Priority)

Enhance documentation to make the project more maintainable and easier for new developers to understand.

### Recommendations:

- **API Documentation**:
  - Add KDoc comments to all public functions and classes
  - Document expected request/response formats for each endpoint

- **Setup Instructions**:
  - Update README.md with clear setup and configuration instructions
  - Add environment variable documentation

- **Architecture Documentation**:
  - Create an ARCHITECTURE.md file explaining the project structure and design decisions
  - Include information on the template system, routing, and how to add new tools

## 5. Monitoring and Observability (Medium Priority)

The current monitoring is limited to a basic health check endpoint.

### Recommendations:

- **Enhanced Health Checks**:
  - Expand the `/health` endpoint to include component status (database, disk space, etc.)
  - Add version information and uptime statistics

- **Structured Logging**:
  - Configure Logback for structured JSON logging
  - Add request ID generation for request tracing
  - Implement MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for correlating logs

- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Track key application metrics like request count, error rate, and response time
  - Consider adding a simple dashboard for visualizing metrics

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline (Medium Priority)

Set up automated build and test workflows to ensure code quality.

### Recommendations:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - Create a `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for CI/CD
  - Configure automatic building and testing on pull requests and merges to main
  - Add code quality checks like ktlint or detekt

```yaml
# Sample GitHub Actions workflow
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          distribution: 'adopt'
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test
```

## 7. Deployment Configuration (Low Priority)

Document deployment steps for the recommended PaaS platforms.

### Recommendations:

- **Platform-specific Deployment Guides**:
  - Create guides for deploying to Railway, Render, and Fly.io
  - Include configuration files for each platform

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Enhance application code to properly handle environment variables for production settings
  - Create a separate configuration file for production settings

## 8. Performance Optimization (Low Priority)

Enhance performance for better user experience and resource utilization.

### Recommendations:

- **Implement Caching Service**:
  - Use the Caffeine library already included in dependencies
  - Cache expensive operations and frequently accessed data
  
- **Frontend Performance**:
  - Optimize Tailwind CSS for production
  - Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources

## Conclusion

By focusing on these improvements, particularly the high-priority items, you'll create a more robust and maintainable foundation for ToolChest before expanding with additional utility tools. Testing, error handling, and proper documentation are especially critical for ensuring the project's long-term health and scalability.
