# üîç Critical Refactoring Review Process

## Objective
Evaluate the single most critical refactoring opportunity identified in the research findings for the ToolChest codebase, ensuring it provides maximum value with minimal risk.

## Context Management Instructions

### Limited Context Window Management
Since LLM code agents can only maintain 3-5 files in memory at once:
- **Focus on Critical Files**: Only load the files directly relevant to the selected refactoring
- **Reference Summaries**: Use research summary documents rather than loading all original files
- **Divide and Conquer**: When evaluating impact across multiple components, assess them in groups of 3-5 files
- **Structured Notes**: Create structured notes for each component group analyzed

### Working with Original Research
1. Load the research summary document first (not all detailed findings)
2. Extract only the critical refactoring opportunity details
3. If needed, load just the relevant code files mentioned in the research
4. Document any context refreshes during your analysis

## Output Format Requirements

### File Naming Convention
Each review iteration must generate uniquely named files to track progress:

1. Use the same timestamp as the research being reviewed
2. Add `-critical-review` suffix to differentiate from the original research files
3. Include the specific refactoring focus in the slug (e.g., `service-layer-redesign`)

### Structured Review Output
Save your review analysis in a machine-readable JSON format file at `.github/refactoring/critical_refactoring_review_{timestamp}.json` with the following simplified structure:

```json

  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",

## Instructions

### Review Focus
- **Single Opportunity**: Identify and evaluate only the most critical refactoring opportunity
- **Maximum Value**: Ensure the selected refactoring provides the highest impact-to-effort ratio
- **Minimal Risk**: Validate that the implementation approach minimizes potential disruption
- **Immediate Actionability**: Focus on refactorings that can be implemented incrementally

### Selection Criteria
When determining the single most critical refactoring opportunity, prioritize:

1. **Pain Point Resolution**: How effectively it addresses a significant pain point
2. **Foundation for Future Improvements**: Whether it enables further refactorings
3. **Risk Level**: Lower-risk opportunities that don't threaten system stability
4. **Implementation Complexity**: Prefer simpler implementations that can be completed quickly
5. **Value Delivery**: How quickly it will deliver tangible improvements

### Assessment Dimensions

#### Value Assessment
- **User Impact**: Will it improve the end-user experience?
- **Developer Experience**: Will it make the codebase easier to maintain?
- **Performance**: Will it improve system performance?
- **Maintainability**: Will it reduce technical debt?

#### Risk Assessment
- **Scope**: How many components are affected?
- **Complexity**: How complex is the implementation?
- **Test Coverage**: Is there sufficient test coverage to validate changes?
- **Dependencies**: Does it affect critical system paths?

#### Architectural Alignment
- **Monolithic Design**: Does it preserve the monolithic application structure?
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Does it maintain the SSR + HTMX approach?
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Does it reinforce proper service encapsulation?
- **Dependency Management**: Does it improve or maintain proper dependency injection?

### Implementation Review
1. **Step Validation**: Assess if the proposed implementation steps are complete and logical
2. **Incremental Approach**: Confirm the refactoring can be implemented incrementally
3. **Testing Strategy**: Verify that sufficient test coverage is planned
4. **Rollback Plan**: Check if a rollback strategy is included
5. **Success Metrics**: Validate that clear success metrics are defined

## ToolChest Architectural Principles to Validate Against

### Core Principles
- **Monolithic Design**: Single Ktor application with all routes, services, and rendering
- **Low Operational Costs**: Prefer solutions with minimal infrastructure requirements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-side rendering first, HTMX for enhancement
- **Single Instance**: Design for single-instance deployment initially
- **Static Generation**: Pre-generate static content where possible

### Technology Decisions
- **Backend Framework**: Ktor with FreeMarker for server-side rendering
- **Frontend Enhancement**: HTMX for dynamic interactions without heavy JavaScript
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS via CDN for utility-first styling with minimal footprint
- **Database**: SQLite initially (migration path to PostgreSQL when traffic justifies)
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
- **Caching**: Local Caffeine Cache + browser caching with proper HTTP headers
- **Compression**: Gzip for all text-based responses

## Implementation Strategy Assessment
Evaluate the proposed implementation plan for the following characteristics:

1. **Incremental Approach**: Does it favor incremental refactoring over big-bang rewrites?
2. **Test Coverage**: Does it include comprehensive testing before and after changes?
3. **Documentation**: Is there a plan to document architectural decisions and patterns?
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Does it preserve functionality for existing tools?
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Are there strategies to minimize disruption during refactoring?
6. **Validation Metrics**: Are there clear metrics to validate improvements?

## Verdict Guidelines
Issue one of the following verdicts with supporting rationale:

- **PROCEED_TO_IMPLEMENTATION**: The refactoring opportunity is well-defined, high-impact, low-risk, and ready to implement
- **REVISE_APPROACH**: The refactoring goal is valuable but the implementation approach needs refinement
- **SEEK_ALTERNATIVE**: The selected refactoring is too risky or low-value and an alternative should be prioritized

For any verdict other than PROCEED_TO_IMPLEMENTATION, provide specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.

## Final Review Output
Conclude your review with:

1. A clear recommendation on whether to proceed with the critical refactoring
2. Specific implementation guidance if approved
3. Precise revision requests if changes are needed
4. A concise implementation checklist for developers

Remember that focusing on a single critical refactoring at a time minimizes risk and maximizes the chance of successful improvement.

## Context Window Management Guidelines

### Component Group Analysis
When analyzing different aspects of the refactoring opportunity:

1. **Group Definition**: Define logical component groups of 3-5 files that need to be assessed together
2. **Sequential Processing**: Process one component group at a time
3. **Cross-Component Notes**: Create simplified representations of dependencies between components
4. **Context Refresh Points**: Document where you need to clear your context and load new files

### Concise Documentation Method
For each component you analyze, create a concise summary with:
- Key functionality provided
- Current implementation issues
- Proposed changes
- Dependencies on other components
- Impact assessment
